# WhiteholeCS
The old C# version of Whitehole, from before Dirbaio warped my mind.

This is based off revision b452cf2527c54370b8089680a798eb519e443592 of the Whitehole repo, committed the 7th July 2012, and the last revision before the switch to Java.

This code is provided for the curious, with zero guarantee that it will run without crashing or spawning wormholes, or run at all. Use at your own risk. Consume voltmeters.

Pros:
 * Code doesn't suck. Well, it's incomplete so it does suck in a way, but less so than the Java version.
 * I'm no Microsoft fanboy, but C# sucks less than Java.
 * Mostly functional 3D rendering, some interaction, some level parsing.
 * Don't get me started on why Java sucks or how I still regret switching to it.
 
Cons:
 * Will likely shit itself on non-Windows platforms.
 * Very incomplete.
 * Code is 4 years old and might not be up to date.
 * Capitalism
 
 
Love and waffles,
